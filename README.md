# lockout
Inspired by [Thomer M. Gil's](http://thomer.com/) [lockout script](http://thomer.com/lockout/). (This is a simplified version.)

There are three scripts:
1. lockout-hosts - Block access to a set of hostnames
1. lockout - Block outgoing Internet access
1. unlockout - Restore outgoing Internet access
